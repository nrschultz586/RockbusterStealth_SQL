Exercise 3.8

1: Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers.

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average
FROM	
	(
	SELECT
		customer.customer_id,
		customer.first_name,
		customer.last_name,
		city.city,
		SUM(payment.amount) AS total_amount_paid
	FROM
		customer
	JOIN
		payment ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
	JOIN
		address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
	JOIN
		city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
	WHERE 
		city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule(Dhulia)', 
		'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
	GROUP BY
		customer.customer_id,
		customer.first_name,
		customer.last_name,
		city.city
	ORDER BY
		total_amount_paid DESC
	LIMIT
		5
	)


2: Find out how many of the top 5 customers you identified in step 1 are based within each country.

SELECT
	country.country,
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
	COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer
JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id	
LEFT JOIN
	(SELECT
		customer.customer_id,
		customer.first_name,
		customer.last_name,
		city.city,
		country.country,
		SUM(payment.amount) AS total_amount_paid
	FROM
		customer
	JOIN
		payment ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
	JOIN
		address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
	JOIN
		city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
	JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
	WHERE 
		city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule(Dhulia)', 
		'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
	GROUP BY
		customer.customer_id,
		customer.first_name,
		customer.last_name,
		city.city,
		country.country
	ORDER BY
		total_amount_paid DESC
	LIMIT
		5) AS top_5_customers
	ON customer.customer_id = top_5_customers.customer_id
GROUP BY country.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
