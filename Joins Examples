Exercise 3.7 (Career Foundry)
1.	Write a query to find the top 10 countries for Rockbuster in terms of customer numbers. 

SELECT
  counry.country,
  COUNT(customer.customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM
  customer
JOIN
  address ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
JOIN 
  city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
JOIN 
  country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
GROUP BY 
  country.country
ORDER BY 
  numbner_of_customers DESC
LIMIT 
  10;

2.	Next, write a query to identify the top 10 cities that fall within the top 10 countries you identified in step 

SELECT 
  country.country,  
  city.city, 
  COUNT(customer.customer_id) AS number_of_customers
FROM 
  customer
JOIN
  address ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
JOIN 
  city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
JOIN 
  country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
WHERE country.country IN 
  (
    SELECT 
      country.country
    FROM 
      customer
    JOIN
      address ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
    JOIN 
      city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
    JOIN 
      country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
    GROUP BY 
      country.country
    ORDER BY 
      COUNT(customer.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 
      10
  )
GROUP BY 
  city.city, 
  country.country
ORDER BY 
  number_of_customers DESC
LIMIT 
  10;


3.	Now write a query to find the top 5 customers from the top 10 cities whoâ€™ve paid the highest total amounts to Rockbuster. The customer team would like to reward them for their loyalty!

SELECT 
  customer.customer_id, 
  customer.first_name, 
  customer.last_name,  
  city.city, 
  SUM(payment.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM 
  customer
JOIN 
  payment ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
JOIN 
  address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
JOIN 
  city ON address.city_id = city.city_id
WHERE city.city IN ( 'Aurora','Atlixco','Xintai','Adoni','Dhule(Dhulia)','Kurashiki','Pingxiang','Sivas','Celaya','So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY 
  customer.customer_id, 
  customer.first_name, 
  customer.last_name,
  city.city
ORDER BY 
  total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 
  5;
